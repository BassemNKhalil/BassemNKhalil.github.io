### Mini #1: Add all props in SPFx wp by default

In the base webpart (the one that extends `BaseClientSideWebPart`), change the line `description: this.properties.description` to be `...this.properties`

Full code block after the change below

```
public render(): void {
  const element: React.ReactElement<ISampleWebPartProps> = React.createElement(
    SampleWebPart,
    {
      // description: this.properties.description
      ...this.properties,
    }
  );

  ReactDom.render(element, this.domElement);
}
```

Note that while all props under `ISampleWebPartProps.ts` will now be available via `this.props`, they will not show automatically under the property pane. One way to manage that is to only surface key properties using property controls and add [Property Editor](https://pnp.github.io/sp-dev-fx-property-controls/controls/PropertyPanePropertyEditor/) to access a full JSON of all properties as an advanced mode.
