# Run SPFx over SSH

## How I used a Linux server as my dev env. while still working on my M1 Mac

I love my M1 Mac, it's smooth and super-performant - it does however make things a bit hard to build for SharePoint SPFx mainly due to Node support on Apple silicon.

To setup, I created an Ubuntu VM in Azure which defaulted to SSH keys. From there, I followed this to [connect to a remote host](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/ssh#_connect-to-a-remote-host) - the only part missing was [how to reference a key file](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/troubleshooting#_improving-your-security-with-a-dedicated-key)

Now I just `gulp serve` and the Browser on my Mac serves that WebPart over SSH from the Linux VM
