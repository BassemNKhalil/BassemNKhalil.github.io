# Alias for nvm-windows

## Quickly switch node version without having to memorise the exact node version

When using `nvm-windows` as opposed to the OG `nvm`, one thing that really bugs me is how nvm use requires a full version: <br />
`nvm use 10` - this fails<br />
`nvm use 10.23.1` - this works just fine

While there's a good chance you'll get used to (and memorise) the specific versions you have installed, I'm usually of the habit to keep only one version of each major version (latest v10 for SPFx dev, latest v14 for SPFx 1.12+ and M365CLI etc. and the occasional v8 for on-prem or v15 for non-SharePoint and M1 silicon). One thing that's very useful is to alias these commands to simplify:

The basic `Set-Alias -Name node10 -Value nvm use 10.23.1` didn't work but following this article to [create an alias for a command with parameters](hhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.utility/set-alias?view=powershell-7.1#example-5--create-an-alias-for-a-command-with-parameters) it was possible to create these as functions:

```
Function setNode10 {nvm use 10.23.1}
Set-Alias -Name node10 -Value setNode10

Function setNode14 {nvm use 14.15.4}
Set-Alias -Name node14 -Value setNode14
```

The last part is to make that permanent by persisting these aliases in PowerShell - see the notes [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.utility/set-alias?view=powershell-7.1#notes) but it requires full permissions i.e. won't work in a typical locked down work environment.
