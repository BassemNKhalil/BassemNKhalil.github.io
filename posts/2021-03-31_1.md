# Azure Bot - connectivity issues

## Error sending this message to your bot: HTTP status code Forbidden

Tracing Azure connectivity today, unable to connect to a vanilla Bot based off a knowledge base (which I confirmed works well in another unrestricted environment). Whenever I used the 'Test in Web Chat' to test the bot, no response was provided - just silence. Looking at the Channels, I could see an error with a corresponding timestamp for every time I tested from the web chat interface.

As always, my first instinct was networking/firewall but how do I trace that to something I can relay to the responsible team?

Bot troubleshooting doco to the rescue. A quick Google search directed me to [this gem](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bot-service/bot-service-troubleshoot-general-problems?view=azure-bot-service-4.0) - it includes detailed instructions to trace connectivity via the following commands using the Debug console in Kudu

```
nslookup directline.botframework.com
curl -I directline.botframework.com

nslookup ivr-sr-bot.botapps.amat.com.
curl -I https://ivr-sr-bot.botapps.amat.com/api/messages
```

In our case, we had access to the directline but not the ivr-sr-bot
