# Package versioning in SPFx solutions

Recently, I've been working on releasing a few SPFx components for an Intranet project I'm working on. Given how SharePoint automatically handles updating SPFx components when a new version is available, it made sense to automate versioning rather than changing a version number in three different files with every release.

A quick Google search took me to an [old gem from Stefan Bauer](https://n8d.at/how-to-version-new-sharepoint-framework-projects/) as well as a [more recent adaptation from Hugo Bernier](https://tahoeninjas.blog/2020/03/30/display-the-solution-version-in-your-web-part/) - I needed a bit of both to achieve what I want.

By default, NPM includes `npm version` which bumps the version in both `package.json` (and `package-lock.json` if you have one) using `npm version major|minor|patch`. However, SPFx relies on the version number in `package-solution.json`. The code below syncs both.

It is two-part: The main bit uses a gulp task (from Hugo's post, in step 3 - thank you) to create a `sync-version` task which updates the SPFx version to match the NPM package version. I included an excerpt of it towards the end for history keeping as well.

The other part (thanks to Stefan) is an NPM task to run the `sync-version` gulp task every time the NPM package version is updated. There's a `postversion` event that's triggered every time `npm version` is run so it seemed like the right place for it. All I needed was to add `"postversion": "gulp version-sync && git add . && git commit --amend --no-edit"` under `scripts` in the `package.json` file. My only addition here is to use `--amend` since `npm version` already creates a commit. This way, a single commit would track version changes to all three files.

Gulp task for reference

```
build.initialize(require('gulp'));

// Change starts here
let syncVersionsSubtask = build.subTask('version-sync', function (gulp, buildOptions, done) {
    this.log('Syncing versions');

    const gutil = require('gulp-util');
    const fs = require('fs');

    var pkgConfig = require('./package.json');
    var pkgSolution = require('./config/package-solution.json');

    this.log('package-solution.json version:\t' + pkgSolution.solution.version);

    var newVersionNumber = pkgConfig.version.split('-')[0] + '.0';

    if (pkgSolution.solution.version !== newVersionNumber) {
        pkgSolution.solution.version = newVersionNumber;

        this.log('New package-solution.json version:\t' + pkgSolution.solution.version);

        fs.writeFile('./config/package-solution.json', JSON.stringify(pkgSolution, null, 4), function (err, result) {
                if (err) this.log('error', err);
            });
    }
    else {
    this.log('package-solution.json version is up-to-date');
    }

    done();
});
let syncVersionTask = build.task('version-sync', syncVersionsSubtask);
build.rig.addPreBuildTask(syncVersionTask);
```
